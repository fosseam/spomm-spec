# SpOMM – Spherical Object Meta Model

**SpOMM** (Spherical Object Meta Model) is an experimental metadata model designed to describe spatially or logically coherent units – so-called “spheres”. It serves as a generic and structured format to represent objects, places, media, concepts, or processes in a consistent way.

## Purpose and Motivation

SpOMM was developed to:
- enable structured metadata for heterogeneous objects in a unified model
- represent both physical and virtual “spheres” (e.g. geospatial data, conceptual entities, media artifacts)
- support reusability, interoperability, and machine-readability across domains
